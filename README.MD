# Tanzim's Front End Web Portfolio
This folder contains a series of freecodecamp web development projects which are being used as the front end web portfolio. Please see the results at the below link:

<https://mtanzim.github.io/webPortfolio/>

These projects were developed mainly with vanilla JS, jquery, css and html. Upon completing the above projects, I've started to study back end, and additional front end libraries such as React (including redux, router etc.) Please see my github portfolio for details.
